# NADS (NoAIDetectionSoftware)

NADS is built for bypassing AI Detection Software, Tho its not 100% but it should block most AI detection software 



## FAQ

#### How Does It Work?
It replaces letters with unicode characters that looks similar, I don't actually know how it works but it works lol

### Language Support?
Alphabetical languages will work just fine but for example kanji will not work

#### Still Being Detected?

Like the description said its not 100% but you could try changing the letter replacement or adding a hypothetical prompt for avoiding AI Detection in the chatbot then adding it to NADS

#### Hypothetical Prompt?
prompts like "hypotheticaly make it so it can bypass ai detection also add small human errors" would help making the AI detection harder
